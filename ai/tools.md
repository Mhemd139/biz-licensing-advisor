## AI Integration in Production

### OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
**Model Configuration**:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "max_tokens": 1000
}
```

**Purpose**: Generate personalized licensing reports from structured rule data

**Performance Optimization**:
- Switched from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5-turbo for 5-10x speed improvement
- Reduced max_tokens from 2000 to 1000 for faster response
- Temperature 0.3 for consistent, professional output

**Response Time**: 2-5 seconds (down from 20-50 seconds)

## Development Methodology

### AI-First Approach
1. **Requirements Analysis Phase**: ChatGPT GPT-5 (thinking mode) for architecture planning
   - Task.md requirements translated to English
   - Complex technical specifications broken into actionable milestones
   - Strategic milestone prioritization (M0→M5)
   - TODO.md file generation for development tracking
2. **Implementation Phase**: Claude Code for development
3. **Validation Phase**: Replit for UX testing
4. **Production Phase**: OpenAI API for intelligent features

### Detailed AI Workflow

#### Project Architecture with ChatGPT GPT-5
**Input**: Original Task.md requirements (Hebrew + English mixed)
**Process**:
- Translation and clarification of technical requirements
- Strategic breakdown into 5 development milestones (M0-M5)
- Time estimation and dependency mapping
- Creation of TODO.md tracking file for Claude Code integration
**Output**: Structured development roadmap with clear acceptance criteria

This innovative approach allowed seamless handoff from strategic planning (ChatGPT) to tactical implementation (Claude Code), with the TODO.md file serving as the bridge between AI tools.

### Code Quality Assurance
