Technical Task: Business Licensing Assessment System
General Background

You are required to develop a system to help business owners in Israel understand the relevant licensing requirements for their business.
The system will receive information about the business and return a personalized report with the relevant regulatory requirements.

Work Materials

You have received a PDF/Word file with business licensing data for restaurants (raw data in Hebrew). You must process the data and build a system that uses it.

Important Note: You do not need to process all the information in the file. It is enough to focus on part of the data (your choice) to demonstrate the solution.

Functional Requirements
1. Data Processing

Read and process the data from the attached file (PDF/Word)

Convert it into a structured format (JSON/CSV/Database)

Map business characteristics to regulatory requirements

2. Digital Questionnaire

Develop a questionnaire that collects the following information:

Business size (in m²)

Number of seats/occupancy

At least one additional characteristic (use of gas, serving meat, delivery services, etc.)

3. Matching Engine

Develop logic that matches user answers to regulatory requirements:

Filter based on size and occupancy

Consider special characteristics

4. Smart Report Generation Using AI ⭐

This is the main and most important part of the task

Use a language model (LLM) to create a customized report:

Integration with a language model (OpenAI GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

Smart processing of requirements – the model will receive raw data and turn it into a clear, understandable report/summary

Personalization – the report will be tailored to the specific characteristics of the business

Clear and accessible language – the model will translate “legal language” into understandable business language

Content organization – division into categories with priorities and recommended actions

Technical Requirements
Architecture

Frontend: Simple user interface (HTML/CSS/JS or React/Vue)

Backend: API server (Node.js/Python/Java – your choice)

AI Integration: Integration with a language model API

Data: Store data (file/Database – your choice)

Required & Recommended Development Tools

Use of AI tools for development is mandatory and must be documented:

Recommended Tools:

Cursor AI

Windsurf

Replit

GitHub Copilot

Recommended (Not Mandatory) Technologies

Frontend: React, Vue, or plain HTML/JS

Backend: Node.js + Express, Python + Flask

AI: OpenAI API, Claude API, or similar

Database: JSON files, SQLite, PostgreSQL

Expected Deliverables
1. Source Code & System

Complete Git repository with commit history

End-to-end working system runnable locally

Working API with documented endpoints

Functional frontend with questionnaire and report interface

Active AI integration that generates real reports

2. Data Processing

Processing script to handle the PDF/Word file

Processed data in structured format (JSON/CSV)

3. Comprehensive Documentation
Main README:

Project description and objectives

Detailed installation and run instructions

List of dependencies and versions

Technical Documentation:

System architecture – basic diagram and component breakdown

API documentation – all endpoints

Required Submission Details:

Link to repository

List of AI tools used

Details of the main language model

3 screenshots of the system in action

Timeline

Additional Notes

AI First: Using AI tools is an advantage, not a drawback – use them and document it.

Functionality over aesthetics – no need for sophisticated design/UI.

Real examples – ensure the system generates relevant reports.

Questions – you may reach out anytime by email.

Document decisions – important to explain why you chose specific solutions.
